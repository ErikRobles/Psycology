Works in Chrome great but cross browser still has problems. Slider Element covering text on re-size and in full screen in some browsers..

11/11/17 Added some webfixes. Helped a little but still cross browser issues. Looks great in Chrome and Opera. The rest are still pushing my slider and menu button down into the content section of the page.
