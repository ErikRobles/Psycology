Need help.
==============Development history.=====================================
Looks great in full screen but when getting close to mobile size, mediaquery won't kick in. Thanks in advance.

Updated November 10 2017 
Added max-width: 100% to css .slideshow-content element as well as min-width: 730px.

Version 3 now ready. added dropdown menu November 10 2017
Works in Chrome great but cross browser still has problems. Slider Element covering text on re-size and in full screen in some browsers..

11/11/17 Added some webfixes. Helped a little but still cross browser issues. Looks great in Chrome and Opera. The rest are still pushing my slider and menu button down into the content section of the page.
Version 2 no longer applicable. Useless file. I still need to learn how to delete it. 

============================================== Important Changes ============================================================

November 13th 2017 
Renamed main website folder to "Psycoterapia" no longer using earlier versions. New conditional code in css that targets certain elements in the header to make it compatible with Internet Explorer 11. First line of text non-responsive in IE11 but everything else is looking good and responding well in the other browsers. Ready to start designing the other pages. 

November 14th 2017 added "Terapia" page and started working on "Preguntas Frecuentes" page.
All pages done and uploaded to GitHub. The last problem I am facing is to eliminate the large amounts of white space between the content and the footer except for the index.html page.
